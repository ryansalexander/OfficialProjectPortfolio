Security Log Manager Details

This program was originally a project for my Data Structures course.
It is a hypothetical system for maintaining a hash table of actions by users.

The program reads a txt file and stores the data in a hash table.

Here is an example of the file contents:

USERNAME, TIMESTAMP, ACTION, RESOURCE

Each line is comprised of the day a username, a timestamp, the action
the user performed, and the resource accessed.

This information is hashed using Fibonacci hashing and stored.

The commands are as follows:
Profile: generate an Operational Profile between two times
	-Retrieve data between these times from the hashtable
	-Sort the data as a list using mergesort before output
Report: generate a User Report for a particular username
	-Retrieve data related to a particular username from the hashtable
	-Sort the data as a list using mergesort before output
Quit: exit the Security Log Manager
Help: view the commands
